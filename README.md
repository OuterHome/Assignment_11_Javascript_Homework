For the part 2 filters, I chose to keep the "filter table" button and run things via "on click" vs "on change," as I don't like tables jumping around on me until I complete the filter components. I added a "clear filters" button to make this easier on the user; pressing it will clear all current filter inputs and reset the table to the default.
